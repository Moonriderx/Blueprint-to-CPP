In Game dev all booleans in Unreal are prefixed with b. If you see a uint with the b prefix it is declared as a bit field like uint8 bIsInitialized:1 The 1 in the end indicates that it only uses 1 bit. 
bIsInitialized == true is perfectly fine to do even though it is a uint8. The reason a bit field is used instead of a bool is to save memory and the only difference between a uint8 bit field and a bool is the way it is declared.

For example the number after uint specifies the Size of the Integer uint32 ist an unsigned integer with 32 Bit so it can hold values from 0 to 2^32 The same goes for uint16 (16 Bit) and uint8 (8 Bit)
